# I'm a hobby programmer
I'm a hobby programmer, I particularly enjoy using C, and sometimes C++, and maybe even asm sometimes :3 <br>
I like to do various things, but mostly find messing with low level concepts to be fun :3 <br>
<br>
I'm also a furry, and a femboy uwu <br>
I like cute things :3 <br>
<br>
I may not have much on my profile *yet*, but I am planning on adding more projects soon owo <br>

## language preference
- I like C because it's a very sharp tool; it's easy to cut yourself by accident (segfault, memory leak, UB, etc), and it's harder to use, but it provides much better control. <br>
- C++ is like a slightly blunter tool; it's easier to use, and harder to cut yourself, but you don't quite have as much control. <br>
- asm is like a blade, with no handle, that is razor sharp; It's really easy to get cut, and it isn't too practical, but ***sometimes*** lets you reach in where you couldn't before.

## low level enjoyment
I enjoy low level things because I just find it fun to do things myself :3 *(even though it may not be practical)* <br>
It's fun to understand how the computer actually works, and what higher level programming languages, or libraries, abstract away <br>

## additional info
If you want, you can look at my projects; maybe learn from them, or teach me something :3 <br>

You can use any pronouns you want to refer to me :3 <br>
