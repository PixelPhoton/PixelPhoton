# hobby programmer, likes C/C++.
I like programming as a hobby, particularly using C, and sometimes C++
I enjoy making things myself, rather than using a library, even though this may not always be practical
I find it fun to use low level concepts such as manual memory management (`malloc` and `free`)

if you want, you can look at my projects; maybe learn from them, or teach me something :3
