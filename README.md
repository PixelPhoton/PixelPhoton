# a hobby programmer!
I'm a hobby programmer, I particularly enjoy using ~~C~~ Zig, but i also do random other things too :3 <br>
I like to do various things, but mostly find messing with low level concepts to be fun :3 <br>
<br>
I may not have many repos *yet*, but I am planning on adding more projects soon!<br>
