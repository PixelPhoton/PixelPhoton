# I'm a hobby programmer
I'm a hobby programmer, I particularly enjoy using C, and sometimes C++, and maybe even asm sometimes. <br>
I like to do various things, but mostly find messing with low level concepts to be fun. <br>
<br>
I may not have much on my profile *yet*, but I am planning on adding more projects soon. <br>

## interests
- reinvent the wheel, *(not practical, but fun!)* doing things yourself that are normally provided by libraries, or even making your own compiler. <br>
- experimentation, I like experimenting with things, maybe even doing it wrong the first time, because failure is the best way to learn. <br>
- other, I don't know how to classify this, but doing things that are rarely done, and unique but complex projects, are fun. <br>
-- an example being, a cli memory visualiser <br>

## language preference
### how I think of it
- I like C because it's a very sharp tool; it's easy to cut yourself by accident, and it's harder to use, but it provides much better control. <br>
- C++ is like a slightly blunter tool; it's easier to use, and harder to cut yourself, but you don't quite have as much control. <br>
- asm is like a blade, with no handle, that is razor sharp; It's really easy to get cut, and it isn't too practical, but ***sometimes*** lets you reach in where you couldn't before. <br>
### my experience and opinion
- C is the best mixture of performance to ease of use, in my opinion. <br>
- C++ is much easier to use sometimes, but comes with a small amount of overhead. <br>
- asm offers maximum performance, functionality, and precision, but it's challenging to work with. <br>

## low level enjoyment
I enjoy low level things because I just find it fun to do everything myself, even though it may not be practical. <br>
It's fun to understand how the computer actually works, and what higher level programming languages, or libraries, abstract away. <br>

## additional info
If you want, you can look at my projects; maybe learn from them, or teach me something :3 <br>

You may use any pronouns to refer to me. <br>
